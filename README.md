The folder ./src contains the files where solutions where completed.

./src/invoice.json --> is an invoice that needs to be used into the problem # 2. This is a json file.
./src/invoice_data.edn --> is an invoice that needs to be used into the problem # 1. This is an edn file.
./src/invoice_item.clj --> this file contains the solution for problem # 3.
./src/invoice_spec.clj --> this file contains the solution for problem # 2.
./src/main01.clj --> this file contains the solution for problem # 1.

All the solutions were running using REPL. the commands used are described at the final of the code.
Also, every one of the solutions has comments as documentation, that describes the approach and functions implemented.

Thanks, :)
